            <h2>Rankala Lake - A Historic & Scenic Landmark</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Rankala Lake, located near the Ambabai Temple in Kolhapur, is a
              popular recreational spot built by Maharajah Shahu Chhatrapati.
              Surrounded by gardens and the iconic Shalini Palace, Maharashtra’s
              only star-rated palace hotel, it offers a vibrant atmosphere with
              street food delights like Bhel-Puri and Ragda-Patties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rankala Lake has witnessed significant events dating back to
              750-850 AD. Once a black stone mine, earthquakes in the 9th
              century transformed it into a lake. It features notable landmarks
              such as the grand Nandi idol, Sandhya Math, and scenic ghats like
              Rajghat and Maratha Ghat. The lake has also been a hub for the
              film industry, with many movies shot at the nearby ShantKiran
              Studio, founded by filmmaker V. Shantaram.
